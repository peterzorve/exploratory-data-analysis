# Exercise 11: Hierarchies of stocks

Previously, you used k-means clustering to cluster companies according to their stock price movements. This time, perform _hierarchical_ clustering of the companies.  You are given a NumPy array of price movements `movements`, where the rows correspond to companies, and a list of the company names `companies`.

SciPy hierarchical clustering doesn't fit into a sklearn pipeline, so you'll need to use the `normalize()` function from `sklearn.preprocessing` instead of `Normalizer`.
"""

import pandas as pd

fn = '../datasets/company-stock-movements-2010-2015-incl.csv'
stocks_df = pd.read_csv(fn, index_col=0) 

companies = list(stocks_df.index)
movements = stocks_df.values

# I inserted this cell
stocks_df





"""
**Step 2:** Make the necessary imports:

 + `normalize` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
 + `linkage` and `dendrogram` from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`.
 + `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.
 
 """

from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


"""
**Step 3:** Rescale the price movements for each stock by using the `normalize()` function on `movements`.
"""


movements_normalized = normalize(movements)
movements_normalized


"""
**Step 4:** Apply the `linkage()` function to `normalized_movements`, using `'complete'` linkage, to calculate the hierarchical clustering. Assign the result to `mergings`.
"""

mergings = linkage(movements_normalized, method='complete')
mergings



"""
**Step 5:** Plot a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering, using the list `companies` of company names as the `labels`. In addition, specify the `leaf_rotation=90`, and `leaf_font_size=10` keyword arguments as you did in the previous exercise.
